It's definitely inconvenient to only have the online UI to use right now...
How am I supposed to make new folders like this..? Is it possible, that it is not possible?

Aaas if that was not possible, I just had to upload a folder via file upload. Now I wanted to push to an existing pr and Titi reminded me, that I had to switch the branch _before_ editing, which I now did-so it should work... ^_^
